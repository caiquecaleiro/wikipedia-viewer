# Wikipedia Viewer - Free Code Camp
This is the [Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)
project that was required by FCC.

The user can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries. Also, there is a random link, which will
search for a random article on Wikipedia.         

The app uses these technologies:

* AngularJS 1.5
* Bootstrap 3.3

## Style and structure

This app follows [John Papa's AngularJS style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide),
which is the style guide recommended by the AngularJS core team.
